Instructions:
To run the program titled "hw1_print.c", first compile it using the icc 
or gcc comand (i.e., run the following to obtain an executable file 
called "hw1_print-c": icc hw1_print.c -o hw1_print-c). If you do not use 
the -o flag, your program will compile to a generic executable called 
'a.out'. 

As soon as you have created your executable files for the programs 
"hw1_print.c" and "hw1_print.c" using the above commands, you can run 
the respective programs by entering the following command into your 
command line: ./hw1_print-c (or ./hw1_sum-c). 

For any questions or concerns, please contact me! Thanks!
